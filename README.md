# RPiMusicBox
A small MPC Client for a music box project using the Rasberry Pi

This project uses the pi3g TFT touchscreen display with a size of 320x240 pixels
as well as some, mostly kitbashed, hardware.

Hardware controls for the player include five keys, one rotary encoder with integrated key and two LEDs.

The six keys are set up into one charlieplexed setup, while the LEDs are also charlieplexed.
